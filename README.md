# WebStorm Tips & Tricks

So after spending my entire undergraduate programming in Java and using Eclipse IDE, I became accustomed to all of the hotkeys in eclipse. I kept the useful keybindings in Eclipse and adopted it into WebStorm. I also found a few helpful plugins in WebStorm that I used in alphabetizing and incrementing selected lines. You can download my settings in this repo or on [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ti7qwem5pza8ef/jm-webstorm-settings.jar?dl=0).
To import my settings go into WebStorm and navigate to `File > Import Settings`

# Here are some useful keybindings:
###  Navigating/Searching for a file — Keybound to: `CMD + SHIFT + R`

### Going into a function/any text and finding the original source: (This is extremely useful when I have a bunch of import statements and I want to quickly navigate to the source file) — Keybound to:`F3`

### Auto Format File (Highlight the lines you want to format then press the keybinding) — Keybound to: `CMD + SHIFT + F`
 * For better formatting checkout my guide on adding Prettier to WebStorm: [here](https://medium.com/@jm90mm/adding-prettier-to-webstorm-a218eeec04d2)

### Alphabetize Lines, first you’re going to need to import the plugin (To do that in WebStorm, navigate to `Preferences > Plugins > Browse Repositories` and search for `Line Sorter`) — Keybound to: `CTRL + SHIFT + L`

### Incrementing selected lines, you’re going to need to import the plugin `String Manipulation` — Keybound to: `CMD + SHIFT + I`
